# Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes method for document classification

## Abstract

We investigate generative methods for document classifications. We first apply text-mining techniques to our corpus of documents to reduce the number of features. We then apply naive-Bayes method to obtain probability distributions over our vocabulary set in four different types of documents (atheism, politics, science and sports). This method is used with a smoothing parameter that we can vary to understand its contribution.
